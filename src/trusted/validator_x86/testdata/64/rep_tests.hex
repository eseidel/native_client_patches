# This file does some simple tests to see if we recognize when the REP/REPNE (F2 F3)
# prefix bytes are allowed.

# The following is an example of an instruction without the REP/REPNE prefix.
#  add %al, %al
00 c0

# The following is the same instruction with an illegal REP prefix.
f3 00 c0

# The following is the same instruction with an illegal REPNE prefix.
f2 00 c0

# The following is an example of a multibyte instruction explicitly requiring
# a REP prefix.
#   movss %xmm0, [%rdx]
f3 0f 10 02

# The following is an example of a multibyte instruction explicitly requiring
# a REPNE prefix.
#   movsd [%rsp+0x10], %xmm2
f2 0f 11 54 24 10

# The following is an example of an instruction that can get a REP prefix.
#    insb
6c

# The same instrucition with a REP prefix.
f3 6c

# The same instruction with a REPNE prefix.
f2 6c

# The following is an example of an instruction that can get a REP/REPNE prefix.
#    cmpsb
a6

# The same instruction with a REP prefix.
f3 a6

# The same instruction with a REPNE prefix
f2 a6
