This directory contains valgrind-related files:
  * ./valgrind.h and ./memcheck.h -- public valgrind headers
     needed to communicate NaCl-specific memory management to valgrind.
  * ./bin/* -- pre-built valgrind binaries which can be used with NaCl.
    Memcheck and TSan binaries can be updated from the ThreadSanitizer buildbot:
    wget http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/tsan/binaries/memcheck-r${REV}-amd64only-linux-self-contained.sh -O memcheck
    wget http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/tsan/binaries/tsan-r${REV}-amd64only-linux-self-contained.sh -O tsan
