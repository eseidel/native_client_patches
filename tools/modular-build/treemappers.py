# The tree mapper functions below -- AddHeadersToNewlib() and

# If we need more ad-hoc tree mappers, it would make sense to split
# this file up and use a different method for tracking when these
# functions' definitions have changed.  But for now, since there is
# only a small number of them, it is simpler to keep them in one place
# and use the file-based identity tracking method discussed below.

  #  1) It lets us ignore parts of the tree that the Scons build does
